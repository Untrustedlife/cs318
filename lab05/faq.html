    <h3>Can I make tapas at home?</h3>
    <div class= "answer">
    <P>It is not only possible but easy. Some can be made in a jiffy, others need more time and skill. Some of the easiest tapas can be had from a can of top-quality Spanish preserves - try serving some good mussels on potato chips. Or a salad of pimientos del piquillo with albacore tuna or salted anchovies spiked on a stick with pepper-stuffed olives. A selection of Spanish cheeses  or charcuterie - Ibérico salchichón, chorizo and ham - would be the perfect tapa to pass around among a group of friends.

    <h3>What is menu del dia (menu of the day)?</h3>
    <div class= "answer">
    <P>It is a menu that changes every day and is widely available in restaurants all over Spain. Diners can choose from a selection of starters, main dishes and desserts, all of which change with the seasons. The starter might be a salad, pasta, a soup, or a medley of vegetables, and the main dish would usually be meat or fish or a hearty pulse stew. Desserts always include fresh fruit and often caramel custard, curd cheese with honey or a portion of cake. Prices vary depending on the location but are usually between 7 and 15 euros per person (2010). The average price for a menu of the day in Madrid is 10 €. Included are a drink, bread and, sometimes, coffee. The regular customers choosing the menu of the day are people who work in the district but do not have time to return home for lunch at midday. Today such restaurants are facing serious competition - in price, but not in quality, from fast-food establishments.</P>

    <h3>What are mealtimes in spain?</h3>
    <div class= "answer">
    <P>In Spain, desayuno (breakfast) is usually between 8 and 9 in the morning, comida or almuerzo (lunch) at about 14.00 or 14.30, and cena (dinner) as from 21.30. Half way through the morning, many Spaniards take a break from work for a coffee and something to eat (a bun, a portion of Spanish omelet or a small sandwich or bocadillo), and the merienda (afternoon break) at about 18.00 is often the favorite meal for children. The routine tends to be more flexible at weekends, with the custom of the aperitif or before-meal drink often pushing back mealtimes.</P>
